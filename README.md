Rock Paper Scissors spinoff written in Python for the Team Treehouse Contest

Team Treehouse just so happened to put out a contest for the programming language I like the most. PYTHON!!!

# How to play

1. Download the project
2. Download python 3.x
3. Locate **saber.py** through the terminal
4. In the terminal, type 'python3 saber.py' and press [ENTER]
5. Game should start


# For continuous play, complete steps 1 - 3

4. In the terminal, type 'python3' and press [ENTER]
5. Once in the Python interpreter, you should see '>>>'
6. Type 'from saber import play'
7. This will automatically start the first instance of the game
8. Once you've run through the game, you should see '>>>' again
9. From now on, you can just type 'play()' to start the game
10. Once you're done playing type 'quit()' to exit the interpreter
11. After exiting the interpreter, you'll need to start from step 3 to play the game again.
